# Getting Running on Various Platforms

These guides assume you want to build from the source. You can also download the latest package and run the appropriate pre-compiled binary for your platform from the [releases section](https://github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/releases) of the repo.

# Quick Start

You can download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud/releases), unzip it and run the binary to get started, or if you prefer to build it yourself, follow the instructions below.

A youtube playlist to getting started has been set up here:

You can compile and run it locally with:

> `go run .`

Or you can just build the binary if you prefer:

> `go build -o GoMudServer`

> `./GoMudServer`

Or if you have docker installed:

> `docker compose up --build`


# HTTPS With Certificate Files

GoMud already supports HTTPS when you provide certificate files.

For a guided config update, run:

> `make https-setup`

The helper updates `_datafiles/config.yaml` and creates a timestamped backup first.

1. Get a certificate and private key for the hostname players will use.
2. Set `FilePaths.HttpsCertFile` to the certificate path.
3. Set `FilePaths.HttpsKeyFile` to the private key path.
4. Set `Network.HttpsPort` to the HTTPS port.
5. Optionally set `Network.HttpsRedirect` to `true`.

Restart GoMud after applying the settings.
